    Parameters
    ----------
    field : np.ndarray
        Magnetic field values for which the the resistance was measured.
        This can be a multidimensional array in which case the last
        dimension will be considered as the swept dimension.
    r : np.ndarray
        Resistance values in Î© which were measured.
        This can be a multidimensional array in which case the last dimension
        will be considered as the swept dimension.
    reference_field :
    model : {'full', 'simplified'}, optional
        Model used to describe the WAL. 'simplified' corresponds to the situation
        in which either the Rashba term or the linear Dresselhaus term can be
        neglected. 'full' corresponds to a more complete model, however each
        evaluation of the fitting function requires to find the eigenvalues
        of a large and as a consequence may be slow.
    truncation : int, optional
        Both models imply a truncation of the number of Landau levels
        considered: in the 'simplified' case this enters the evaluation of a
        series, in the 'full' case the size of the matrix whose eigenvalues
        need to be computed.
    guess_from_previous : bool, optionnal
        When we perform a fit for multiple sweeps should the fitted values of
        the previous sweep be used as guess for the next sweep.
    guesses :
        Guessed fit parameters to use. Those should include the dephasing
        field, both linear fields (for simplified the second one is ignored),
        the cubic term field.
    plot_fit : bool, optional
        Should each fit be plotted to allow manual verification.

    Returns
    -------
    dephasing_field : np.ndarray
        Dephasing field and standard deviation.
    linear_soi : np.ndarray
        Fields and standard deviations corresponding to the linear SOI terms.
        This is returned as a ...2x2 array in which the first line is the
        Rashba term and the second the Dresselhaus.
    cubic_soi_field : np.ndarray
        Field and standard deviation corresponding to the cubic Dresselhaus
        term.
